# MTE 380 - Mechatronics Engineering Design Course

## Phase 1
In the first month of the course the objective was to design a Stewart platform to be able to solve a maze using a marble. We built and designed a model and are controlling it with Arduino. At this stage of the project the platform can move in 8 directions to a maximum of 10 degrees in any of those directions (controlled with using a joystick). We are able to solve the maze in under 30 seconds! :tada:

## Phase 2
For phase 2, the goal was to come up with a practical application for the Stewart Platform. We decided to make a camera stabilizer  which is kind of like a gimbal but for large cameras. The platform can move around pitch and roll as well as z-translation. The measurements are taken with an IMU mounted to the same platform that the camera sits on. :video_camera:
