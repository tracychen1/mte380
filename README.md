# MTE 380 - Mechatronics Engineering Design Course

## Phase 1
In the first month of the course the objective was to design a Stewart platform to be able to solve a maze using a marble. We built and designed a model and are controlling it with Arduino. At this stage of the project the platform can move in 8 directions to a maximum of 10 degrees in any of those directions (controlled with using a joystick). We are able to solve the maze in under 30 seconds! ðŸŽ‰
